    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the numpy library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic\n",

    "\n",
    "* The size of training set is 34799\n",
    "* The size of the validation set is 4410\n",
    "* The size of test set is 12630\n",
    "* The shape of a traffic sign image is (32,32,3)\n",
    "* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a visualization of the training data set as example. It is a bar chart showing the quantity and distribution of the total training data in each classes.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Design and Test a Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, I decided to convert the images to grayscale because the shape informations of the traffic signs are enough to do the classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a traffic sign image before and after grayscaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I normalized the image data to let the pixel values from [0,255] to [-1,1] so as to let the follwing training more robust, otherwise, it is too sensitve to the outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of an original image and an augmented image, actually, that is not apparently different. \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image3]\n",
    "\n",
    "At the very end, i reshape the image sets, which adds a dimension representing the number of color channels and shuffle the image in each of image dataset respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example : shape of training set is changed from (34799, 32, 32) to (34799, 32, 32, 1).\n",

    "#### 2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.\n",

    "#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total neural network model is based on tensorflow, and some important parameters used in the training are listed below:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "My final model results were:\n",
    "* training set accuracy is : 99.6%\n",
    "* validation set accuracy is : 95.4%\n",
    "* test set accuracy is : 95.1%\n",
    "\n",
    "I adjust the original LeNet and create my own 'Model' Architecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "At first, i train with original LeNet Network, and the validatzionaccuracy reaches at about 89%, which is below what we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I add batch normalization for each conv layers to avoid the model from not being convergent. The accuracy of validation then reaches at about 92&, which has a great improvement in comparision with the former one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, i add convolution layer 3 and change the correponding input and ouput of each layer, which adds extra parameters of the whole network. Although the calculation speed for each epoch will decrease, but the accuracy increased once more. \n",
    "\n",
    "After that, I delete the max pooling for conv2 layer and just use the max pool once so as to aviod losing too much information.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also try to change the batch_size and epochs and finally i choose the batch size 128 and epoch 50, because the runtime is quite acceptable and the result is quite good\n",
    "\n",
    "After all above, the validation accuracy reaches at 95.4%, which meets the demand.\n",
